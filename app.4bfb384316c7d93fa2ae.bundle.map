aurelia-loader-webpack config, this module is added as an extra entry\n// before any other code executes so that PAL.Loader is properly configured.\n// There are several tricky points worth noticing.\n// \n// We don't add aurelia-loader-webpack itself as an entry point (used to until 2.0 RC2)\n// because it (transitively) brings too much bagage with itself, most notably polyfills.\n// This made it super-hard to add other polyfills before Aurelia's and led to various bugs.\n//\n// We don't add custom code in aurelia-pal or aurelia-loader or aurelia-bootstrapper to detect\n// the Webpack environment and configure the loader because they might live in a DLL.\n// If they do, they would bring aurelia-loader-webpack along in the DLL and this is a special \n// library that *has to be in the main chunk.*\n//\n// The over-complicated design I've settled upon in the end is to use this special module\n// as an entry point that configures aurelia-loader-webpack. It has minimal static imports:\n// just aurelia-pal, which itself has no other dependencies and doesn't run much code.\n// It hacks the loader field into a getter so that it can synchronously load aurelia-loader-webpack\n// just in time when it is demanded by aurelia-bootstrapper.\n// This enables users to load polyfills before aurelia-loader-webpack is actually loaded.\n\nimport { PLATFORM } from \"aurelia-pal\";\n\nvar Loader;\n\nObject.defineProperty(PLATFORM, \"Loader\", {\n  get: function() {\n    return Loader || (Loader = require(\"aurelia-loader-webpack\").WebpackLoader);\n  },\n  set: function(value) {\n    Loader = value;\n  }\n});\n","exports = module.exports = require(\"../../../../app/node_modules/css-loader/dist/runtime/api.js\")(false);\n// Module\nexports.push([module.id, \".ux-choice {\\n  cursor: pointer;\\n}\\n\", \"\"]);\n","exports = module.exports = require(\"../../../../app/node_modules/css-loader/dist/runtime/api.js\")(false);\n// Module\nexports.push([module.id, \"/* CALCULATIONS */\\n.ux-input-component--outline {\\n  --inner-input-v-padding: 12px;\\n  --inner-input-v-padding: calc(var(--label-font-size, 12px) / 2 + 6px);\\n  /* MIN HEIGHT OF OUTER COMPONENT */\\n  --min-height: 51.6px;\\n  --min-height: calc(\\n    1 * var(--line-height, 1.6) * var(--font-size, 16px) + \\n    2 * var(--inner-input-v-padding, 12px) + \\n    2 * var(--border-active-width, 2px));\\n  /* TRANSLATION OF LABEL WHEN INPUT IS EMPTY */\\n  --half-h: 25.8px;\\n  --half-h: calc(var(--min-height, 51.6px) / 2);\\n  --abs-empty-label-pos: 13px;\\n  --abs-empty-label-pos: calc(var(--half-h, 25.8) -
